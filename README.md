- HW1: Camera Calibration 
    - Capture chessboard images by our own smart phone (Remember to close the auto focus function)
    - Find our intrinsic matrix and extrinsic matrixs. Then, plot the position of the camera while taking each images. 

- HW2:
    - Hybrid image
        - Sum a low-passed filtered version of a image with another high-passed filtered version of second image.
        - Try both ideal and Gaussian filters
    - Image pyramid
        - A collection of images at different resolution
        - Show both Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids
    - Colorizing the Russian Empire
        - Automatically produce a color image from the digitized Prokudin- Gorskii glass plate images with as few visual artifacts as possible

- HW3: Automatic Panoramic Image Stitching
    - Find interest point by SIFT
    - Feature matching by SIFT features
    - RANSAC to find homography matrix
    - Warp image to create panoramic image

- HW4: Structure from Motion
    - Take our own photos, do calibration on our own photos, and reconsturct 3D model

- [Note] All assignments are done in a group of three.
